description: A portrait of Reginald Arthur Wilson, his collar badges show that
  he was a Torpedo Coxswain, a trade that was only available to Petty officers
  (PO) and Chief Petty Officers (CPO). His service record showed that he had the
  rating of TC (Torpedo Coxswain) from 29 April 1938, so this photo is taken
  around that period.
