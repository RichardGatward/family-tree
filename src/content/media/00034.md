description: A studio portrait of Reginald Arthur Wilson, he is sat down in the
  middle row in the centre of the picture. His collar badges show that he was a
  Torpedo Coxswain, a trade that was only available to Petty officers (PO) and
  Chief Petty Officers (CPO). His service record showed that he had the rating
  of TC (Torpedo Coxswain) from 29 April 1938, so this photo is taken around
  that period.
