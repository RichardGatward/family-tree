description: This photo along with 00281, 00287, 00240 share similar
  handwriting. Similar slant, shared words 'all' this is likely to associate
  these photos with Edmund Harpwood Chessel, son of Louisa Wilson. He only
  served between 1910-1914 when he died when his last ship the Bulwark sunk.
transcription: A little of what we are having up this way.
