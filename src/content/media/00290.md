description: A studio portrait of Reginald Arthur Wilson, his collar badges show
  that he was a Torpedo Coxswain, a trade that was only available to Petty
  officers (PO) and Chief Petty Officers (CPO). His service record showed that
  he had the rating of TC (Torpedo Coxswain) from 29 April 1938, so this photo
  is taken around that period.
