  S1. Starboard mounting for a six inch gun. 


  There was a Petty Officer [Richard Eves](https://www.cwgc.org/find-records/find-war-dead/casualty-details/2876688/RICHARD%20EVES/) and Leading Seaman [James Horrace Wainscoat](https://www.cwgc.org/find-records/find-war-dead/casualty-details/412173/JAMES%20HORACE%20WAINSCOAT/) J/4716(PO) who were both casualties aboard HMS Southampton during the Battle of Jutland (31/5/1916). Which suggests this photo was taken on HMS Southampton in May 1916.
transcription: SI crew nearly all killed here including poor old Dick Eves and Wainscoat
