  **HASTINGS POLICE BAND. PUBLIC PERFORMANCE**. The inaugural public open air concert by the members of the Hastings Police Band was given on Monday evening in the enclosure at Wellington-square, which Mr. J. H. Landsell kindly placed at their disposal for the purpose. Unfortunately, the weather was rather impropitious, and rendered a somewhat abrupt termination of the proceedings. The band, under the baton of Mr. Stutely, acquitted themselves well, and in the interval since their last appearance in public an effort attended with marked success appears to have been made in the direction of greater proficiency. Very appropriate was the opening item, a march, “On the Beat,” while another march, “Hastings Castle,” which has been formerly referred to in these columns as the work of the Rev. Canon Jones, was executed in a most praiseworthy manner. The same remark applies, to all the other items in the programme, of which some were well-known popular airs. – *Hastings and St Leonards Observer - Saturday 03 September 1898*
