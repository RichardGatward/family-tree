title: 1939 Register
description: The *1939 Register* is one of the most important twentieth century
  genealogical resources for England and Wales. The 1931 census was destroyed by
  fire. No census was taken in 1941 because of the war. So the *1939 register*
  is the only national census-like resource available for this period.
